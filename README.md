This started as some practice for Data Science class with Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) using MLB data. Now I am seeing if I can put together a pitch prediction app using scikit learn.

- the data used first ws from retrosheet.org
- importing standard libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn
- basic information gathering about the DataFrame
    - attributes
    - info
    - describe
