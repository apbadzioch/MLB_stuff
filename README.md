# Project Overview
This project started as a way to practice data science skills for my Python Data Science class at Houston Community College (Fall 2024). While working with various datasets, I realized that baseball is built on data and statistics, and since I was watching the MLB playoffs at the time, it became the perfect insperation.

The goal: Predict the type of pitch a pitcher is most likely to throw, based on their tendencies and handedness. Over time, this will evole into a flexable ML tool using logistic regression, random forests, and plans to extend into reinforcement learning for strategic sequencing.
